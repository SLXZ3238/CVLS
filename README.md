Computer Vulnerability Inquiry System

This is a computer vulnerability query system edited with HTML. In theory, it's not a system. It doesn't have a database and doesn't have any docking API. These files are pure HTML, CSS and JS. It's just for quick response. Real-time data update, if necessary, you can develop it yourself, please be sure to abide by the Creative Commons Agreement, this system is a magical modification, called the Linux query system, if there is any infringement, please be sure to contact my email, thank you for your cooperation!
